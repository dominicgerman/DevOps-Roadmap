The goal of this project is to introduce you to the basics of IaC using Terraform. You will create a DigitalOcean Droplet and configure it using Terraform.
Requirements

If you have been doing the previous projects, you should already have a Linux server running. If not, setup a Linux server on DigitalOcean, AWS or another cloud provider.

You are required to write a Terraform script that will create a Droplet on DigitalOcean. The Droplet should have a public IP address, and SSH access. You should also be able to SSH into the Droplet using the private key.

You can use this guide from Digital Ocean and Digital Ocean provider documentation to get started.
Stretch goal

Write Ansible playbook that will configure the server. You can use the same playbook from the previous project.
